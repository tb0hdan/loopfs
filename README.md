# LoopFS - Content Addressable Storage (CAS) File Server

## Project Description

LoopFS is a Content Addressable Storage (CAS) file server that stores and retrieves files based on their SHA256 
cryptographic hash. 

This approach ensures data integrity, eliminates duplicate storage, 
and provides a unique identifier for each file based on its content.

Linux only.
